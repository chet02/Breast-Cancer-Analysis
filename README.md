### Data Modelling and Analysis on Breast Cancer Dataset
**Date**: December 2022

#### Overview:
This project aims to analyze a comprehensive breast cancer dataset, containing over 6.7 million mammograms, to unearth patterns associated with breast cancer occurrence, with a focus on specific demographics such as ethnicity and age.

#### Dataset Details:
- **Size**: 6,788,436 mammograms
- **Date Range**: January 2005 - December 2017
- **Key Features**: Participant characteristics previously shown to be associated with breast cancer risk

#### Methodology:

1. **Data Modeling**:
   - Focused on discerning the essential dimensions from the dataset.
   - Employed tools within the SQL Server Management Studio for robust data modeling practices.
   
2. **Data Processing with SSIS and SSAS**:
   - Developed SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) packages to simplify and automate the data extraction and transformation processes.
   - Utilized SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) for advanced analytics, constructing multidimensional models to understand the data's intricacies.

3. **Data Analysis with Python**:
   - Transitioned to a Jupyter Notebook environment to utilize Python's data science capabilities.
   - Leveraged libraries such as Pandas and NumPy to clean, preprocess, and analyze the data.
   - Dug deep into the data to discern patterns based on ethnicity and age groups.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Employed Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, turning complex data insights into digestible visual stories.
   - Highlighted demographics most affected by breast cancer, enabling easier interpretation of the data and facilitating potential future research or medical endeavors.

#### Key Findings:
- Discovered patterns regarding breast cancer prevalence among different ethnicities.
- Identified age groups more susceptible to breast cancer.

#### Tools & Libraries Used:
- **Database & Data Warehousing**: SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), SSIS, SSAS
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Python Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

#### Future Scope:
This project can be further extended by incorporating additional datasets, exploring other potential risk factors, or using machine learning to predict breast cancer risks based on the identified patterns.
